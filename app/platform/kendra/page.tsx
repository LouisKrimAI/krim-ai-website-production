                Kendra is the runtime of KrimOS — where every co-worker reasons, and where the
                rules of what they may do actually live. It validates each action before it acts,
                and gets sharper from each outcome it records.

                <p className="mt-4 font-sans text-body text-ink-2">
                  Before any action fires, it passes through Krim-Nyāya — 33 validators that ask, in
                  formal logic, whether this action is allowed to happen at all. Validation is not a
                  review after the work; it is the gate the work must pass to become real. Most
                  actions clear. The ones that don’t are flagged and handed to a person, with the
                  rule that stopped them in plain words.

                <p className="mt-4 font-sans text-body text-ink-2">
                  Because every action and its result land on one record, Krim-Learn sees what
                  actually worked and feeds it back through ten learning loops. It is disciplined,
                  not magic — a pattern only joins the shared library once it clears an effectiveness
                  threshold of around 80%, and what is shared is anonymised, aggregated and
                  opt-out. The system compounds; a baseline in the first quarter is materially beyond
                  it by year two.

                Safety and intelligence aren’t traded off here. The validation that keeps every

                improvement from one source of truth.
